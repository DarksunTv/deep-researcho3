# GHL Integration Roadmap

## Completed Work
- [x] **Authentication & Configuration**
  - Environment-based configuration is implemented (see src/config/auth.js).

- [x] **GHL API Client**
  - Basic CRUD operations for interacting with the GHL API (implemented in src/api/GHLClient.js).

- [x] **API Endpoints**
  - Express routes that map to the GHL API client methods (see src/api/routes.js).

- [x] **Chatbot Integration**
  - A command handler is implemented to route operations such as listing, getting, creating, editing, and deleting workflows (see src/api/chatbot.js).

- [x] **AI Workflow Integration**
  - AI capabilities are in place for generating workflow summaries and suggestions (see src/ai/workflowAI.js). *Note*: The AI Assistant in src/ai/aiAssistant.js currently has an error and requires updating.

- [x] **Logging & Error Handling**
  - Winston-based logging is configured for error tracking (see src/utils/logger.js).

- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**
  - A suite of tests has been set up using Mocha and Chai (located in src/tests).

## Issues / Incomplete Work
- **AI Assistant Error:**
  - Error: `TypeError: Configuration is not a constructor` in src/ai/aiAssistant.js.
  - *Action Required*: Update the initialization of the OpenAI client to use the correct constructor and parameters.

- **Supabase Integration:**
  - Verify that src/api/supabaseIntegration.js is correctly configured with the necessary environment variables and dependencies.

## Current Issues & Fixes

### AI Assistant Error
```javascript
// Old code in src/ai/aiAssistant.js:
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Fix: Update to current OpenAI client
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

### Supabase Integration Fix
```javascript
// Update src/api/supabaseIntegration.js:
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY,
  {
    auth: { persistSession: false }
  }
);
```

## Next Steps to Start
- [ ] Fix the AI Assistant module in src/ai/aiAssistant.js to align with the latest OpenAI client usage.
- [ ] Verify and test the Supabase integration in src/api/supabaseIntegration.js.
- [ ] Run the tests using `npm test` to ensure all functionality is working as expected.
- [ ] Launch the UI server with `npm start` (typically accessible at http://localhost:3000).
- [ ] Enhance the chatbot UI and expand API endpoints based on further feature requirements.
- [ ] Update documentation continuously as new changes are implemented.

## Package Updates
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "openai": "^4.0.0",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary polyfill packages installed:
  ```bash
  npm install browserify-zlib querystring-es3 path-browserify crypto-browserify stream-browserify os-browserify stream-http util url buffer
  ```

- Then, clean your build cache if necessary (for example, delete your `dist` or `build` directory) and restart your development server. If any issues persist, double-check that you're not including server-only modules (like Express) in your client-side bundle.
