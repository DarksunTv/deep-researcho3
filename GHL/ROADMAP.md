# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the next 10 steps to advance our project and ensure a robust, production-ready solution.

## 1. Expand and Enhance Unit & Integration Tests [ ]
- Broaden test coverage across modules, including API integrations and AI functionalities.
- Utilize Mocha, Chai, and Sinon for comprehensive testing.

## 2. Implement Robust Logging [x]
- Create a dedicated logging module using Winston. (Completed)
- Configure logging for both development and production with detailed error reporting.

## 3. Integrate Cursor AI Module [ ]
- Develop a module to integrate Cursor AI for contextual memory and improved responses.
- Begin with simulated responses for testing, transitioning to live API calls in production.

## 4. Enhance Supabase Data Caching [ ]
- Optimize data caching mechanisms (with TTL and expiry controls) to ensure fresh data retrieval.
- Improve query performance and reduce redundant API calls.

## 5. Improve Error Handling Across Modules [ ]
- Establish centralized error handling and reporting for all API interactions.
- Implement retry and graceful degradation mechanisms.

## 6. Update Documentation and Developer Guides [ ]
- Expand the existing documentation to cover architecture, API usage, testing procedures, and setup instructions.
- Maintain clear developer guidelines and contribution instructions.

## 7. Set Up Continuous Integration (CI) [ ]
- Configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated tests, builds, and linting.
- Ensure that every push/pull request runs the full test suite and quality checks.

## 8. Containerize the Application [ ]
- Develop Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations for consistent development, testing, and production environments.

## 9. Perform Security and Dependency Audits [ ]
- Integrate regular audits of dependencies and security checks (e.g., npm audit).
- Address vulnerabilities and update packages as needed.

## 10. Establish Deployment Pipelines for Staging & Production [ ]
- Set up automated deployment pipelines for staging and production environments.
- Include environment variable management, rollback strategies, and monitoring solutions.
