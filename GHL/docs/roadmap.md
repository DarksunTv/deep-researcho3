# Project Roadmap: AI-Assisted Code Guidance Integration

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the key phases and milestones for the AI-Assisted Code Guidance Integration project, which leverages the o3-mini model with Cursor integration for real-time code assistance. Our strategy is to build a lightweight MVP in YOLO mode—with minimal upfront requirements—and then iterate quickly based on feedback.

## Phase 1: Initial Planning and Setup
- **Define Objectives:**  
  - Confirm project scope, key capabilities, and overall system requirements.
- **Repository & Environment Setup:**  
  - Establish the project repository with the required file structure.
  - Create environment configuration files (development, testing, staging, production).
- **API Configuration:**  
  - Setup API keys for OpenAI, GoHighLevel, and Supabase.
  - Validate basic connectivity with each API.

## Phase 2: Core Integration Development
- **AI Integration:**  
  - Develop the `aiAssistant.js` module to handle prompts using the o3-mini model.
  - Configure prompt handling and response formatting.
- **API Integration:**  
  - Build the `ghlIntegration.js` module to interact with the GoHighLevel API.
  - Setup the `supabaseIntegration.js` for data storage and retrieval.
- **UI Integration:**  
  - Implement a basic Cursor integration using the `cursorIntegration.js` module, with a demo endpoint for initial feedback.

## Phase 3: Prototyping and Iteration (YOLO Mode)
- **Rapid Prototyping:**  
  - Assemble the integration endpoints (`/api/ghl-data`, `/api/ai`, `/api/cursor-demo`) quickly with minimal validation.
  - Focus on rapid feedback loops and build a minimally viable product.
- **Internal Testing & Feedback:**  
  - Conduct internal demos.
  - Gather insights and identify quick wins and potential roadblocks.

## Phase 4: Testing, Optimization, and Scaling
- **Testing:**  
  - Write and run unit tests for each module and integration via the CI pipeline.
  - Conduct integration testing using mock services where necessary.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Optimize API calls, error handling, and AI response configurations (e.g., tweaking `max_tokens`, `temperature`).
- **Scalability:**  
  - Assess and prepare for scaling the solution, ensuring performance under load.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Continuous Improvement
- **Deployment:**  
  - Deploy the tested version to the staging environment first, then production.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Set up monitoring mechanisms to review API performance and system logs.
- **Iteration:**  
  - Use end-user feedback and monitoring data to implement iterative enhancements.
- **Roadmap Revisions:**  
  - Update and refine milestones as the project matures.

## YOLO Mode Guideline
- **Minimal Setup:**  
  - Focus on core functionalities that "just work" with as little setup as possible.
- **Rapid Iteration:**  
  - Embrace an early release with known limitations, then improve iteratively.
- **Simplicity & Efficiency:**  
  - Prioritize essential features over over-engineering. Keep the initial codebase lightweight and adaptable.

## Milestones & Timeline
- **Week 1-2:**  
  - Establish project plan and repository structure.
  - Configure environment files and validate API keys.
- **Week 2-4:**  
  - Develop core integration modules (AI, API, UI).
- **Week 4-5:**  
  - Launch a rapid prototype (YOLO mode) and conduct internal demos.
- **Week 5-6:**  
  - Intensively test and iterate on the initial implementation.
- **Week 7+:**  
  - Deploy to production and establish continuous monitoring.
  - Update the roadmap as new requirements and feedback emerge.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm that all required configurations are in place.
2. Begin development with an initial sprint based on this roadmap.
3. Schedule regular review sessions to adjust priorities and tasks as necessary.

This roadmap ensures you can hit the ground running with minimal overhead while keeping the path clear for future enhancements.
