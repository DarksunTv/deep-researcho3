# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Code Guidance Integration

## Overview

This project integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 models with a code guidance UI (Cursor) and connects to external platforms such as GoHighLevel and Supabase for a two-way data sync.

## Objectives

- **Contextual Reasoning:**  
  Leverage o3-mini to interpret project contexts and provide actionable code suggestions.

- **Information Retrieval:**  
  Integrate with external APIs, cache data, and provide it in the UI.

- **Two-Way Integration:**  
  The system will pull information from GoHighLevel and push updates back after processing.

## Architectural Components

- **AI Engine (OpenAI):**  
  - Uses GPT-3.5/4 for code assistance
  - Implements rate limiting and token management
  - Includes fallback error handling

- **API Integrations:**  
  - *GoHighLevel API:* For fetching/updating business data.
  - *Supabase:* For data storage and retrieval.

- **User Interface:**  
  @Cursor integration for real-time AI assistance in code editing.

- **Environments:**  
  Development, Testing, Staging, and Production.

## Implementation Details

- **API Authentication:**
  - OAuth2 flow for GoHighLevel
  - JWT tokens for Supabase
  - API key management for OpenAI

- **Data Flow:**
  - Implement webhook listeners for GHL updates
  - Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
  - Cache frequently accessed data

## Next Steps

1. Finalize requirements and data flow diagrams.
2. Set up the basic project structure and integration stubs.
3. Create CI/CD pipelines and environment deployment configurations.
